This is a Repository with the most asked CS Programming Algorithms and Data Structures in tech interview .

I really enoyed buiding up this repository.  It was a great learning I took crafting these files in order to better understand how data structures were made base of primitive data types as int, float and boolean , also  how advances structures emcompasses  simple data type. it was also outstanding to understand how big algorithms works and to solve daily problems as the salesman travelers by using graphs and tress in a random gird.
